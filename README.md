# Simple twitter list example

This is a simple example to demonstrate how [`fluxible`](http://fluxible.io/) works.
The project is based on [`generator-fluxible`](https://github.com/yahoo/generator-fluxible).

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
```

Execute `npm run dev` to initiate webpack-dev-server (with react-hot-loader support). Browse to `http://localhost:3000` to see a very simple List of tweets with server-side rendering and client-side navigation. When you change files, the client will be hot-reloaded (with the exception of stores) and your application server will restart so that you can see the server-side changes on the next refresh.
